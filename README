== Asterisk - Sphinx Intergration SERVER ==

The full Sphinx and Asterisk integration consists of a server peice, which is this
software.  Also required is the patch to Asterisk to provide the Generic Speech API
with the "Sphinx" engine plugin.


==INSTALL==

make && make install && make samples



The latest versions of the original  software should be available at:

http://scribblej.com/


The latest version of my version (jsgf grammars) is available at:

https://github.com/rampa069/astsphinx_server (server side)
                      
                        and

https://github.com/rampa069/astsphinx_client (client side)


## USE ##

Requires you to have a configuration file, and one or more grammar files
plus the associated dictionary.

 see config.en and config.es in the source tree.


To run this program from the commandline, the syntax is as follows:

./astsphinx 10069 config.es digits-es-2 digits-es-4 digits-es-6 digits-es-8 2>/dev/null

"10069" is the port number to listen on,

"config.es" is the name of the config file, as illustrated above
digits-es-* are the names of grammars to load and make
  available to Asterisk.  Note the grammar in the configfile will 
  not be made available to Asterisk unless it is also listed on the
  commandline.

"2>/dev/null" redirects PocketSphinx-specific output to /dev/null.  
  There can be a /lot/ of this output, I only suggest removing this
  if you are having problems.
